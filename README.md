## 🎨 Design Philosophy

WellWell is:
- **Mobile-first** — Optimized for phone usage during stressful moments
- **Dark-mode default** — Reduces eye strain for morning/evening use
- **Voice-first** — Primary interaction is speaking, with text fallback
- **Minimalist** — Focus on content, minimal chrome
